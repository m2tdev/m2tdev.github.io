          <h2>How to Read This Guide</h2>
          <p>
            In this guide, we will examine the building blocks of React apps:
            elements and components. Once you master them, you can create
            complex apps from small reusable pieces.
          </p>

            <h3>Tip</h3>
            <p>
              This guide is designed for people who prefer
              <strong>learning concepts step by step</strong>. If you prefer to
              learn by doing, check out our practical tutorial. You might find
              this guide and the tutorial complementary to each other.

            This is the first chapter in a step-by-step guide about main React
            concepts. You can find a list of all its chapters in the navigation
            sidebar. If you’re reading this from a mobile device, you can access
            the navigation by pressing the button in the bottom right corner of
            your screen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every chapter in this guide builds on the knowledge introduced in
            earlier chapters.
            <strong
              >You can learn most of React by reading the “Main Concepts” guide
              chapters in the order they appear in the sidebar.</strong

            For example, “Introducing JSX” is the next chapter after this one.
          </p>

          <h2>Knowledge Level Assumptions</h2>
          <p>
            React is a JavaScript library, and so we’ll assume you have a basic
            understanding of the JavaScript language. If you don’t feel very
            confident, we recommend going through a JavaScript tutorial to check
            your knowledge level and enable you to follow along this guide
            without getting lost. It might take you between 30 minutes and an
            hour, but as a result you won’t have to feel like you’re learning
            both React and JavaScript at the same time.
          </p>

        <article>
          <h2>Consider this variable declaration:</h2>
          <pre>
                    <code>
    const element = &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;;</code>
                </pre>
          <p>This funny tag syntax is neither a string nor HTML.</p>
          <p>
            It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We
            recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look
            like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with
            the full power of JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            JSX produces React “elements”. We will explore rendering them to the
            DOM in the next section. Below, you can find the basics of JSX
            necessary to get you started.
          </p>

          <h2>Why JSX?</h2>
          <p>
            React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled
            with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes
            over time, and how the data is prepared for display.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup
            and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with loosely
            coupled units called “components” that contain both. We will come
            back to components in a further section, but if you’re not yet
            comfortable putting markup in JS, this talk might convince you
            otherwise.
          </p>
          <p>
            React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as
            a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It
            also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.
          </p>
          <p>With that out of the way, let’s get started!</p>
          <h2>Embedding Expressions in JSX</h2>
          <p>
            In the example below, we declare a variable called name and then use
            it inside JSX by wrapping it in curly braces:
          </p>
          <pre>
                    <code>
    const name = 'Josh Perez';
    const element = &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {name}&lt;/h1&gt;;
                            
    ReactDOM.render(
        element,
        document.getElementById('root')
    );</code>
                </pre>
          <p>
            You can put any valid JavaScript expression inside the curly braces
            in JSX. For example,
            <code>2 + 2, user.firstName, or formatName(user)</code> are all
            valid JavaScript expressions.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the example below, we embed the result of calling a JavaScript
            function, formatName(user), into an &lt;h1&gt; element.
          </p>
        </article>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Rendering_Elements">
        <header>Rendering Elements</header>
        <article>
          <h2>Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps.</h2>
          <p>An element describes what you want to see on the screen:</p>
          <pre>
                    <code>
    const element = &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world&lt;/h1&gt;;</code>
                </pre>
          <p>
            Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects, and
            are cheap to create. React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to
            match the React elements.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <h3>Note:</h3>
            <p>
              One might confuse elements with a more widely known concept of
              “components”. We will introduce components in the next section.
              Elements are what components are “made of”, and we encourage you
              to read this section before jumping ahead.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <h2>Rendering an Element into the DOM</h2>
          <p>Let’s say there is a &lt;div&gt; somewhere in your HTML file:</p>
          <pre>
                    <code>
    &lt;div id="root"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>
                </pre>
          <p>
            We call this a “root” DOM node because everything inside it will be
            managed by React DOM.
          </p>
          <p>
            Applications built with just React usually have a single root DOM
            node. If you are integrating React into an existing app, you may
            have as many isolated root DOM nodes as you like.
          </p>
          <p>
            To render a React element into a root DOM node, pass both to
            <code>ReactDOM.render():</code>
          </p>
          <pre>
                    <code>
    const element = &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world&lt;/h1&gt;;
    ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));</code>
                </pre>
          <p>It displays “Hello, world” on the page.</p>
        </article>
      </section>

        <article>
          <h2>Function and Class Components</h2>
          <p>
            The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript
            function:
          </p>
          <pre>
                    <code>
    function Welcome(props) {
    return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {props.name}&lt;/h1&gt;;
    }</code>
                </pre>
          <p>
            This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single
            “props” (which stands for properties) object argument with data and
            returns a React element. We call such components “function
            components” because they are literally JavaScript functions.
          </p>
          <p>You can also use an ES6 class to define a component:</p>
          <pre>
                    <code>
    class Welcome extends React.Component {
        render() {
            return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {this.props.name}&lt;/h1&gt;;
        }
    }</code>
                </pre>
          <p>
            The above two components are equivalent from React’s point of view.
          </p>
          <p>
            Function and Class components both have some additional features
            that we will discuss in the next sections.

          <h2>Converting a Function to a Class</h2>
          <p>
            You can convert a function component like <code>Clock</code> to a
            class in five steps:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Create an ES6 class, with the same name, that extends
              React.Component.
            </li>
            <li>Add a single empty method to it called render().</li>
            <li>Move the body of the function into the render() method.</li>
            <li>Replace props with this.props in the render() body.</li>
            <li>Delete the remaining empty function declaration.</li>
          </ol>
          <pre>
                    <code>
    class Clock extends React.Component {
        render() {
            return (
            &lt;div&gt;
                &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;
                &lt;h2&gt;It is {this.props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            );
        }
    }</code>
